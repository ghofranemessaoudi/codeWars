//A person's Life Path Number is calculated by adding each individual number in that person's date of birth, untill it is reduced to a single digit number.
//For example, Albert Einstein's birthday is March 14, 1879. The calculation of his Life Path Number would look like this:
//year: 1 + 8 + 7 + 9 = 25; 2 + 5 = 7
//month: 0 + 3 = 3
//day: 1 + 4 = 5
//final result: 7 + 3 + 5 = 15; 1 + 5 = 6
//Einstein's Life Path Number is therefore: 6
